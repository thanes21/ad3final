# Iman Fanboys Final Project

## Speedrun Search

This application uses Speedrun.com's API in order to search for information regarding speedruns.

- [Speedrun.com](http://www.speedrun.com/)
- [Speedrun API](https://github.com/speedruncom/api)

This is a shiny application and an example of it can be found [here](). Applications include searching for specific games and seeing leaderboards for each category of speed run, an interactive visual plot showing the run times versus rank, a plot showing the country distribution of users in that category, and finally an embedded video showing the world record time for that category.
